            h3 Q1.What is ActiveGNS
            p.
                ActiveGNS is a programmable managed DNS service that allows you to write your own code to control the DNS response
                for your domain name.
            p
                |Similar with other managed DNS services, such as
                a(href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/")
                    font(color="red")  Amazon Route 53,
                a(href="http://dyn.com/dns/")
                    font(color="blue") DynDNS,
                a(href="http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/")
                    font(color="green") DNSMadeEasy,
                |you could set up your A record with multiple IPv4 addresses.
            p.
                Besides, you could also write your own code (in Javascript) to control the DNS response for your domain.

            h3 Q2.Why programmability?
            p.
                Writing your own code to control your DNS response gives you more freedom than a configurable scheme.
            p
                |For example, with a
                font(color="red")  configurable
                |  managed DNS service, you could choose a high-level routing policy such as weighted, and geolocation, see
                a(href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html")  examples of Route 53
                |  for more information.
            p
                | While, with our
                font(color="red") programmable
                |  managed DNS service, you could specify a more sophisticated routing policy to improve your service performance or save your cost. See
                a(href="#")  more examples
                |  of active code.
            h3 Q3.How it works?
            p.
                As shown in the figure, our DNS server serves all DNS requests for the domain name ends with "activegns.org".
            ul
                li The DNS request is first translated to a GNS request.
                li GNS fetch your A record and code from DB then run the code on ActiveGNS.
                li After executing the code, the response is sent back through the DNS server.
